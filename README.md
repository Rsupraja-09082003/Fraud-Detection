# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. By leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, the model identifies and classifies fraudulent activities with high precision.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, simplified categorical variables, and upsampled imbalanced classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categorical columns and selected relevant variables.
- **Model Development**: Implemented XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- **Insights**: Highlighted key factors influencing fraudulent transactions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
The model delivers actionable insights for fraud prevention in financial systems.
